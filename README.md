# Min-heighter

JavaScript algorithm for setting **min-height** to all elements in one row based on the most voluminous one.

Alignment can sometimes be troubling, especially when you need to align all text elements within a flexbox, but the number of siblings isn't equal for each parent. For example, some `person`'s have two and the other three children, so you can't use `flex-grow` to align everything. Try it through `768-1920px` width range. (Styled primarily for 768px breakpoint.)
